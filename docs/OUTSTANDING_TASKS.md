## 📝 Notes & Considerations

### Known Limitations
1. **Apache Beam Pipeline:** Currently uses DirectRunner (local), needs DataflowRunner for production scale
2. **Kafka:** Running single-node in development, needs multi-node cluster for production
3. **Redis:** Single instance, consider Redis Cluster for high availability
4. **Video Streaming:** Currently S3 direct access, implement CloudFront CDN for production

### Technical Debt
1. **Testing Coverage:** Backend at ~60%, frontend at ~40% - target 80% before launch
2. **Error Handling:** Some services need more comprehensive error handling
3. **Logging:** Standardize log format across all services (use structured logging)
4. **Caching Strategy:** Implement comprehensive caching strategy (Redis)

### Risk Mitigation
1. **Production Deployment:** Test in staging environment first
2. **Data Migration:** Backup all data before migration
3. **Rollback Plan:** Test rollback procedure before launch
4. **Monitoring:** Set up alerts before launch, not after
5. **Load Testing:** Run production-scale load tests before launch
